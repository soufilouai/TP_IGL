- this folder contain the js files for the different pages of the website 
- while making a page u can easily add the component u want to be in that page by importing it from the components folder 
- if a page is the same for both admin,user,mod create only one js file named by the actual page type name 

note: i created some js files just so when i push into github the structure of the project is saved 
      u can change them if needed
