- this folder contain the components of the different pages types
- each page type has its own components .js file 
- the different components that will be in this folder are going to be only specific,
  repeated section or elements in a certain type of a page
- if a certain component is repeated in many pages of different type u can put that component in the SharedComponent.js file 

note: i created some js files just so when i push into github the structure of the project is saved 
      u can change them if needed
